# RegisterLoginPHP
This is a basic Register Login Webpages using PHP.


The Register Feature simply adds a User to the File-Based-Storage, and only ever registers 1 user at max.


The Login Feature checks whether the details that are input in to the login page are valid, and if so, "Logs In", which simply goes to an empty Home Page.
