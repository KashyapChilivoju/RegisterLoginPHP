# RegisterLoginPHP
This is a basic Register Login Webpages using PHP.


The First Page to run is root.


The Login Feature checks whether the details that are input in to the login page are valid, and if so, "Logs In", which simply goes to an empty Home Page.

Requirements: 

run schema.sql through mysql workbench


Fix the credentials in the config.php - This is centralized and easier to maintain db credentials for development and production


run this from the terminal: php -S localhost:8000 or execute "Test" Run/Debug Configuration
